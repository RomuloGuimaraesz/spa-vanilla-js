# Project Initialization

**Install Dependencies First**: After the initial project setup, proceed by installing all necessary dependencies before creating configuration files or performing other procedures.<br>This practice helps identify any issues with dependencies early on. If the dependency installation fails, halt the setup process to avoid unnecessary work and overhead.

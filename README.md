# Project Initialization

**Install Dependencies First**: After the initial project setup, proceed by installing all necessary dependencies before creating configuration files or performing other procedures.<br>This practice helps identify any issues with dependencies early on. If the dependency installation fails, halt the setup process to avoid unnecessary work and overhead.

**Early adoption of best practices**: From now on we will also adhere to the use of ES modules by configure the package.json to support it with
"type": "module"
and by creating and renaming the project .js files with the .mjs extension
